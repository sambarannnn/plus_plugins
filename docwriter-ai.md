## Contributing
PlusPlugins welcomes contributions that improve the plugins and cover more platform-specific functionalities. For guidance on setup, running, and contributing to the projects, see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file included in the root directory of the repository.

## Running Example Apps and Tests
Each plugin package contains an example app demonstrating its functionalities. To run the example app or the integrated tests, use commands provided in the `melos.yaml` file located at the root of the repository. 

### Example:
```bash
melos run build:example_ios
```

This will compile and run the iOS example app. Similarly, replace `ios` with `android`, `web`, etc., to run examples for other platforms.

## Repository Maintenance and Contribution Workflow
The repository utilizes Melos to manage multi-package repositories and streamline the workflow. Standard procedures for building, formatting code, and running tests are defined in `melos.yaml`. The workflow typically includes code analysis, formatting checks, and running example apps and tests for different platforms. 

When contributing, it is advised to create a branch per package if working on multiple packages to ease the review and maintenance process. Ensure all pull requests follow the guidelines specified in the repository documentation, enabling maintainers to efficiently review and merge contributions.
